1. Introduction
---------------

This package installs a  GNU Bash shell script that allows  the use of C
language programs as shell scripts.

  The  package makes  use of  the GNU  Autotools.  This  package targets
GNU+Linux platforms.

3. Install
----------

To install from a proper release tarball, do this:

    $ cd ccsh-0.1.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make
    $ make install

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

  The Makefile is designed to allow parallel builds, so we can do:

    $ make -j4 all && make -j4 check

which,  on  a  4-core  CPU,   should  speed  up  building  and  checking
significantly.

  The  Makefile supports  the  DESTDIR environment  variable to  install
files in a temporary location, example: to see what will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/ccsh

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/ccsh

  After the installation it is  possible to verify the installed library
against the test suite with:

    $ make installcheck

  From  a repository  checkout or  snapshot  (the ones  from the  GitHub
site): we must  install the GNU Autotools (GNU  Automake, GNU Autoconf),
then  we must  first run  the script  "autogen.sh" from  the top  source
directory, to generate the needed files:

    $ cd ccsh
    $ sh autogen.sh

notice that "autogen.sh" will run the programs "autoreconf".

  After this the  procedure is the same  as the one for  building from a
proper release tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install


4. Usage
--------

Read the documentation generated from  the Texinfo sources.  The package
installs the documentation  in Info format; we can  generate and install
documentation in HTML format by running:

   $ make html
   $ make install-html


A. Credits
----------

The  stuff was  written by  Marco Maggi.   If this  package exists  it's
because of the great GNU software tools that he uses all the time.
